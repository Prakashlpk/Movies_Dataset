If you look at this data, the first column is the title, which represents the movie's name. The second column is the US Gross, meaning the total box office revenue from the United States. The third column is the Worldwide Gross, which is the total box office revenue globally. The fourth column represents revenue from DVD sales, which is the income generated from DVD sales in the US. The Production Budget refers to the estimated amount spent on making the movie. The "Release Date" refers to the official date when the movie was released. The "MPAA Rating" is the rating given by the Motion Picture Association of America for the movie. The "Running Time" indicates the movie's duration in minutes. The "Distributor" refers to the company responsible for distributing the movie. The "Source" represents the origin of the movie's story, meaning whether the screenplay is based on a book or another source. The "Major Genre" refers to the primary genre of the movie, such as Comedy, Action, or Drama. The "Creative Type" indicates whether the movie is an adaptation, meaning what kind of creative work it is based on. The "Director" represents the name of the movie's director.

The columns such as US gross, worldwide gross, production budget, and ratings from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes, all seem to be descriptive features that provide information about each movie.
